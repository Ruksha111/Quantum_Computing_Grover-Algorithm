# Quantum_Computing_Grover-Algorithm
The primary objective of this research is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of the Groover search algorithm particularly in identifying a specific target state within a quantum system
In this case, the target state is '10'.

Requirements.
first install the Qiskit library using Pip install Qiskit
